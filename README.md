### Inspiration
Often you are confronted with difficult decisions were you don't know how to react. The LLM just give you an unreflected answer, thats not enough you want to know why they decide. so we started building multiple instances to actule discuss and presente the results in a explainable way.

### What it does
It takes your dilemma or ethical situation like your "A friend is cheating on his girlfriend and I know them both very well, should I tell her?" and it helps you by providing a discussing between chose able characters what you could do what you need to take into account before deciding and what possible results can be. you can notch the discussion based on the chosen chars

### How we built it
LlamaSage harnesses the cutting-edge Llama3 LLM (Groq backend) and other groundbreaking GAI technologies to revolutionize ethical decision-making. With Python, FastAPI and React at its core, supplemented by Brave Search API for additional internet search, and advanced techniques like Weights and Biases to track network states, LlamaSage offers unparalleled guidance from diverse voices across time and imagination

### Challenges we ran into
Our journey involved integrating diverse GAI technologies like Groq Llama3, optimizing for real-time responses, and ensuring ethical standards, emphasizing the crucial role of fine-tuning prompts for accuracy. Simultaneously, designing an intuitive user interface and implementing robust security measures underscored meticulous attention to detail throughout LlamaSage's development

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The different AI actule react to each other and they can persuade each other from there opinion and change the result. Also the result is not generic but specific.

### What we learned
Using LLM and working together in a team makes great things possible.

### What's next for LlamaSage
In the pipeline for LlamaSage: refining fine-tuning methods, innovating prompt-engineering, and expanding datasets. Next steps include rigorous testing and user feedback to enhance effectiveness and usability, advancing ethical decision-making globally
